        <p>
            My name is nahom Garefo. I am currently a third year software engineering student at <a href="http://www.aau.edu.et/">Addis Ababa University.</a>
            In the realm of coding and programming, my passion burns like a relentless flame, an unwavering devotion that fuels my every endeavor. 
            The world of lines and algorithms is my canvas, and with each keystroke, I paint a masterpiece of logic and innovation.
            Devotion is the heartbeat of my journey. Every project is a pilgrimage, and every bug is a challenge waiting to be conquered. 
            The late nights spent debugging, the countless lines of code written and rewritten â€“ they are the building blocks of my commitment to excellence.
             I am not merely a coder; I am an architect shaping the future with lines of code.
             <br>
             In a world where technology evolves at an unprecedented pace, my love for coding is the constant, the anchor that keeps me grounded yet propels me forward. 
             It's not just about writing code; it's about crafting solutions, pushing boundaries, and leaving an indelible mark on the digital landscape. My devotion to this craft is unwavering, 
             a force that propels me towards my goals with an unyielding determination.
